# Battleship Game

Welcome to the Battleship game! This is a classic strategy game where you'll try to sink your opponent's ships before they sink yours. Are you ready for the challenge?

## How to Play

1. Enter the coordinates for your ships in the input field. 
2. Use the "Rotate" button to flip the orientation of your ship if needed.
3. If your ship is too long to fit in the designated area, you will need to enter new coordinates.
4. Once you are satisfied with the positions of your ships, press the "Submit" button.
5. Click on the "Play" button to start the game and try to sink your opponent's ships by guessing their positions on the game board.
6. You'll take turns with your opponent to make guesses by clicking on the positions on the game board. The result of your guess will be displayed.
   - If you hit an opponent's ship, it will be marked as a hit.
   - If you miss, it will be marked as a miss.
7. The game will continue until one player sinks all of their opponent's ships.

## Game Rules

1. Each player starts with a fleet of ships: one battleship (size 4), two cruisers (size 3), three destroyers (size 2), and four submarines (size 1).
2. Ships cannot overlap or be placed diagonally.
3. The game board is a 10x10 grid, with letters A to J representing the rows and numbers 1 to 10 representing the columns.
4. You can only make one guess per turn.
5. The game will inform you if you hit or miss a ship, and it will keep track of the number of hits and misses for both players.
